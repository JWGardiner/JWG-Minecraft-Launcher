# JWG Minecraft Launcher

JWG Minecraft Launcher is a Minecraft: Java edition launcher designed to be simple to use, and be able to load a variety of Minecraft mods easier, as well as organising your installations.

By default, it will install everything for the Vanilla game and Forge, Fabric and Quilt modloaders. Now you can more easily upload mods since you don't have to navigate to .minecraft, and you can just upload them directly.

## Installation

When you run it for the first time, it will start installing everything, this means it might take a while and appear as if it's not doing anything; since it's probably downloading everything it needs.

It will automatically update the vanilla client, and you will get a prompt on first run asking whether you want the same for modloaders; I suggest you agree to it as it means you won't have to manually install the jar files.

Every launch it will check for new versions of Minecraft or modded clients.

The time on first launch depends on your WiFi speed; since it's downloading everything it needs.

## How to install

- Firstly install Java 16 or higher, if you've done modding on 1.17+ you probably have it installed already! (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- Make a folder on your computer somewhere, it doesn't really matter where, I recommend somewhere like appdata, or documents, you can name the folder what you want.
- Go to the releases tab on the right, and download the version you want into that folder.
- Right click file "launcher.jar" > Create shortcut and drag the shortcut to your desktop
- Run the shortcut or jar file, and you should see it starting to load.

If it doesn't start loading, go to the issues tab and make a bug report, in the folder you made there should be a file called "Latest.log" which will tell us what happened

You should also provide specifics like what you were doing to cause the crash etc.
