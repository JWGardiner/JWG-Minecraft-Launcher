All contributions are helpful, however some things are to note:
- No malware or potentially harmful code
- Try not to make pull requests for unifinished code

No malware or potentially harmful code is fairly simple
By no pull requests for unfinished code, I mean do not commit something broken or unfinished; if the whole feature isn't done yet, but it's in a useable state (e.g you've made a gui but not the backend), it's okay

Try to keep spacing at 1 tab (4 spaces).
